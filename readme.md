gil is an interactive version of git-log

## installing

assuming `~/bin` is on your `PATH`,
```sh
cd ~/bin
curl -L https://github.com/raylu/gil/releases/latest/download/gil-$(uname -m | sed s/arm64/aarch64/)-$(uname -s | awk '{print tolower($0)}' | sed -e s/darwin/apple-darwin/ -e s/linux/unknown-linux-gnu/) -o gil
chmod +x gil
```

alternatively, download a binary from the [releases](https://github.com/raylu/gil/releases) page

or install from source via `cargo install gil`: https://crates.io/crates/gil

### macOS

```sh
brew install --cask raylu/formulae/gil
```

if you downloaded manually and get an error about how it "canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it 
or malicious software", this is because the quarantine extended attribute has been set by your browser.
either `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine gil` or use `curl`/`wget` to download instead
